🎯 Objective
The aim of this project is to:

Implement a web page from scratch that matches a provided designer file.
Apply fundamental HTML, CSS, and accessibility practices to create a high-quality page.
Ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes without using any external frameworks (like Bootstrap).
Build semantic HTML structures to enhance accessibility and SEO.
🌟 Features
Pixel-perfect design: The web page looks identical to the provided design file.
Responsive layout: Adapts gracefully across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Accessible elements: Follows ARIA guidelines and semantic HTML for better screen-reader compatibility.
Custom CSS styling: Styled with modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox and Grid.
Interactive elements: Incorporates basic interactivity like hover effects and button clicks.
🛠 Technologies Used
HTML5: For semantic and structured content.
CSS3: For styling, animations, and responsive design.
Media Queries: To adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
ARIA Attributes: To ensure accessibility compliance.
Git: For version control during development.
🎨 Design Approach
Layout Construction:

A responsive grid and flexbox-based layout were used to organize the structure.
Media queries ensure smooth transitions between mobile and desktop views.
Color & Typography:

Colors and typography match the original design file precisely to ensure consistency.
Accessible color contrasts were chosen for readability.
Responsive Design:

Viewport meta tag was added to ensure mobile optimization:
html
Copy code
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
Breakpoints were set to adjust the layout on different devices.
♿ Accessibility Considerations
ARIA roles were used to enhance screen-reader navigation.
Alt text was provided for all images to ensure accessibility for visually impaired users.
Semantic HTML elements such as <nav>, <section>, <article>, and <footer> were used appropriately.
Keyboard navigation was tested to ensure usability without a mouse.

🧠 Challenges and Learnings
Responsive Design: Creating a smooth layout without external frameworks required a deep understanding of CSS grid and flexbox.
Accessibility: Implementing proper ARIA roles and semantic HTML reinforced my understanding of accessible web development.
Pixel-Perfect Matching: Ensuring the final design matches the designer file exactly was both challenging and rewarding.
🔮 Future Improvements
Dark mode support: Implementing a toggle for light and dark themes.
Performance Optimization: Minifying CSS and using lazy loading for images.
JavaScript enhancements: Adding simple animations or user interaction using vanilla JavaScript.
